## Managing Your Bibliography

Efficient management of your publications is crucial for academic physicians. We recommend the following software to help manage your library of publications:

- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) with the [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) add-on: 
  - Allows for easy export and automatic updating of your BibTeX file
  - Provides custom citation keys for easy reference
- [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/):
  - Open-source, cross-platform BibTeX management tool
  - Offers direct BibTeX editing and custom export filters

For Mac users, [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io) is also a good option with out-of-the-box support for this workflow.

## Customization

The template is designed to be easily customizable:

- Modify the `\cvsection` commands to add or remove sections relevant to your career.
- Adjust the formatting in the preamble to change fonts, colors, or layout.
- Can change the available sections of your bibliography to suite your needs, using keywords to pull in the bibtex entries
