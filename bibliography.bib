    abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to assess the cost-utility of various screening strategies for CAD in asymptomatic adults. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to simulate outcomes and survival rates. RESULTS: Given model inputs, targeted screening in high-risk populations would cost \$48,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). CONCLUSION: Targeted screening in populations with high CAD risk is likely to be cost-effective by conventional standards.},

This study sought to identify predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with HFpEF. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1000 patients with HFpEF. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 300 patients experienced MACE. Independent predictors of MACE included age, New York Heart Association class, diabetes mellitus, and left atrial volume index. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may help in risk stratification and management of patients with HFpEF.},
